Please run "Demo_CC.m" for the demonstration. Note that Butterfly motion estimation has already been processed. Please refer to Ref. 2 below for addtional Butterfly description. For simplicity, only the S/I navigators are included for demonstration here. The provided motion estimation was from a pediatric patient using a 32-channel coil array.
